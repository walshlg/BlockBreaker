having problems with adding sound.  Secificly, the boing sound that is supposed to play every time the ball hits something.  Put in a print statement where I should detect ball collisions but NEVER get this message.

void OnCollisionEnter2d (Collision2D col){
		print ("Ball has collided");
    
I conclude that for some reason my ball collisions aren't being detected but brick and paddle and wall colllisions are.
